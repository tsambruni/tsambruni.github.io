## Work

I started as Senior Data Engineer at Growens back in May, and it's been one of the best decisions I've made. The work is meaningful, my colleagues are great, and the company culture just clicks with me.

I'm fully remote but never feel isolated. It gives me the flexibility to actually live my life while doing work I care about.

## Fitness

In July, I decided to start running, something I'd never done before. I committed to a 10-week program and went from zero to 14km. Three sessions a week, didn't miss a single one.

Turns out running isn't really my thing. It ate up too much time and didn't fit my lifestyle.

Now I'm back to what works: three days a week of home gym training, plus an easy run on weekends when I feel like it. Much better balance.

But cardio training is good, it matters a lot.
