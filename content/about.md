*Senior Data Engineer* @ **[Growens](https://growens.io/en)**, proud member of Data&Analytics team.

I've spent years in the technical side of things: building pipelines, fixing broken data flows, making stuff work.
But I'm learning hard skills are only part of the equation, and that's only part of what I want to do.

I'm starting to shift my focus toward <mark>the bigger picture</mark>: how data connects with people, teams, and decisions. Technical skills got me here, but I know the next step is about <mark>communication, clarity, and understanding the business side</mark>.

I believe in simple solutions, <mark>honest work</mark>, and that learning never really stops.

Beyond my job, I'm a husband and dad first. That's what drives everything else: staying fit so I can keep up with my kid for decades to come, learning about personal finance to build security for me and my family, and constantly improving myself both professionally and personally.
