# Why I built this site

*October 10, 2025*

I've been thinking about building a personal site for a while now. Not because I think the world needs another tech blog, but because I wanted a space that's truly mine.

## No frameworks, no fuss

This site is intentionally simple: plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No React. No Next.js. No build process (well, except for GitHub Pages doing its thing).

Why? Because I spend my days working with complex data pipelines and orchestration tools. Sometimes it's nice to remember that the web can be simple. You don't always need to `npm install` half the internet to make something work.

## Modern aesthetic

The clean, modern design is inspired by sites like Linear and Vercel. There's something refreshing about simple gradients, clean typography, and subtle animations. Less is more.

Plus, dark mode by default (with a light mode toggle for those who prefer reading in daylight without sunglasses).

## Easy to maintain

The whole site is just a few HTML files and a JSON file for the notes index. To add a new note, I just:

1. Create a new Markdown file
2. Add an entry to `notes/index.json`
3. Push to GitHub

No database, no CMS, no headaches. Just files.

## Learning in public

I believe in learning in public. Sharing what you know (and what you're still figuring out) helps others and makes you a better engineer. This site is my contribution to that philosophy.

If even one person finds something useful here, or learns from a mistake I made, it's worth it.

## Ownership

In an age where most of our writing lives on platforms we don't control, there's something powerful about having your own corner of the internet. No algorithms, no character limits, no platform changes that break your content.

This is my digital home. Simple, clean, and completely under my control.
