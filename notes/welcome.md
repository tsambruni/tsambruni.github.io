# Welcome to my corner of the internet

*October 11, 2025*

Hey! If you're reading this, you've stumbled upon my little digital home. Welcome.

This is where I'll be sharing random thoughts, technical notes, things I've learned, and maybe some questionable opinions about data engineering tools. Think of it as a digital garden where I'm planting seeds of knowledge (and the occasional weed of confusion).

## What to expect

I'm planning to write about:

- Data engineering patterns and anti-patterns
- Tools and technologies I'm experimenting with
- Lessons learned from production incidents (the fun kind)
- Random technical deep dives
- Maybe some coffee reviews, who knows

## Why notes, not blog posts?

I'm calling these "notes" instead of "blog posts" because it takes the pressure off. These are just my personal notes that happen to be public. Some will be polished, some will be rough. All will be honest.

No newsletter, no comments section, no tracking. Just words on a screen.

## Let's connect

If something resonates with you (or if you think I'm completely wrong about something), feel free to reach out. I'm always up for a good technical discussion.

Thanks for stopping by!
